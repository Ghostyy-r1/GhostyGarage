Okay let's work on some minor changes all over in the top header lets move the buttons on the right side to be Discord, Sign in/ Login button and add an animation to the sign in button like a glowing bit to indicate some importantance and add a purple border around the cart button and move it to the last button also add a search bar to the side nav at the top, break up the visual division for a premium feel. In the hero there are a few issues I want to fix the welcome to Ghosty's Garage should be white text for it to stand out and in the hero fix the text that says "The Ultimate Motorcycle Community" the line under motorcycle community stretches too far to the right add a glowing importance to the "join community" button with an animation like the arrow moving and the "explore features" button being renamed to explore products and scrolling to the products section and also a glowing little border around it and on hover before you click it an arrow shows up and animates moving back and forth to indicate it

Fix the about garage section to be more like the old design we created and add more content to it then under add animations to the what we offer cards and make the links under them nicer buttons with that arrow moving again then move the products section up to below what we offer then put the pagnation and then the view All products under it, after products put the testimonials section below that, then add the Join our premuim riders club banner below the products and make a section with membership teirs to subscribe too then an calendar section with events on it for a full year make it a function calendar with events and details and everything then show our featured blog posts (Currently named "Community Highlights"), then I want a section with tabs that have tabs for Video Tutorials with cards, Documentation, Resources tab in a list with about 6 resource cards then a button that says see resources with a button and animated arrow, add view all button under all the content so you can view all then we need the FAQ section followed by the Contact us page then a call to action to join the community and then we need a button that says scroll to top and then keep the footer the same adding more professionalism

Do all these changes
